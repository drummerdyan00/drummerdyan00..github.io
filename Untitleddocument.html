The final design document is in a strong place, with some minor revisions to parts already done, and work needing to be done on the newest sections. I took a large part of the design document with all of section 1, a bit over half of section 2, and a bit over half of section 3. For the project itself I have mostly been in research and data collection which has not been going well, as the data required is not the kind normally given out. However, I have gained a large variety of potential contacts, whether they be competitors or otherwise. Additionally, while it did not produce results I made contact with numerous departments of agriculture and other parties that may hold information such as the NASS, UD department of agriculture, and some african agricultural companies, though none ever responded to me.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">For the winter break, I sadly did not get as much as I really should have gotten as it was a tough month for me. We had economic issues at the house so most of my time was spent helping my family with our business. However, I did get some things done.We never quite decided what our main package was going to be for web scraping, though we were learning towards beautiful soup. So I did some research into R-vest and decided that it would not be useful to our main objective, as while SQL would be nice Diogo has no knowledge of SQL, and thus we would be wasting precious time trying to learn it. Furthermore, scrapy was something that was a bit too command line focused for my tastes and could quite click with it, so that alternative was out. That left us with beautiful soup, which I did some personal research into and got a basic, but serviceable understanding coming into the semester. Additionally, I spent some free time looking for more websites, though that failed so the bot is probably the best.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">For the next few weeks, my main goal is to go into overdrive, at least for me. I want the data bot running by the end of next week in some state, so we can find potential websites. I want the bot that takes those sites and actually scrapes the data working by the end of February. I&rsquo;m hoping to get everything finalized by the end of March, with the design document being finalized by mid March. I&rsquo;m essentially hoping we can leave the last few weeks of April for a nice relaxing fine tuning session.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Post-First Meeting Update</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Capstone Diagram, Nov 6, 2022</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">At this point things are going a lot better, though I&rsquo;m still a bit behind but not too bad.</span></p></body></html>
