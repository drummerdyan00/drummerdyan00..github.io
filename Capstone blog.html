The implementation process has been a bit slow on my end. I have been dealing with a lot this semester in both physical sickness and mental issues, that has delayed me making as much progress on my capstone as I would have genuinely loved to make. I am deeply thankful for my partner picking up much of my slack, and would like to express that. Despite this, a lot of personal progress has been made, if most of it is dealing with failure. I am so used to excelling due to my ability to work hard and touch out most assignments, so when I could not with this project, I gained a vast appreciation for things such as planning, tracking progress, and simple things like the many unexpected pitfalls and what can be done in a certain period of time. Additionally working with team members for long periods of time is another skill I picked up.
	Codewise, the project is entering its final stages. The proxies are mostly setup, the tag filters have some more to be added to but are mostly done. Unless there are still some steps I am not fully clear upon, most of what we have left to do are stretch goals. 
	The Paper is mostly done. I have a draft of chapter 4, Diogo is mostly done with Chapter 5. Chapter 5 was something I didn’t touch much upon because that is not my strong suit. Out of the many categories to talk about, I think the future of the project will be the most interesting. I am somewhat interested in what I am doing, so I do intend to continue it, possibly with 6grain. If not I will likely do the project in my own free time while outside of a job. I have a small fear, but I assume it will not be that the project will not have as big an impact on the data collection of 6 grain as I expect.

      <h2>Capstone Beta Update, Fourth Blog Post</h2>

      <p>I have implemented a lot over this second month, especially as a group. We have got most of the basics of the code up and running, and as such we have a complete whole as of now. Additionally, many of the goals for the beta run have been mostly done. We ensured we got around HTTPS limits, added more items to the search target list, we are almost finished getting tags to ensure download security is working, and we have prevented duplicates from getting downloaded. Now we merely need to find a way to upload this data onto a map for the most part and we should be sufficient.
	The writing of chapter 4 has not yet started but will begin shortly. This is due to me being the bigger lead within getting the actual paper written and my general lack of a true grasp of where we are going. As such, my main goal is trying to hand it off to Diogo who’s familiarity with this field is stronger, while I take up parts of his work. This is something that I am going to work on later with Diogo to try and grasp where we are heading and where we should stop. However the editing of chapter 2 and 3 has been going smoothly and should be wrapping up shortly. 
Generally, while I probably have the weakest handle of the stopping point between all of us, I would say the main features In my mind are as such. The ability to get google searches to search webpages based on certain targets, the ability to store the original links to the datasets for preservation, the ability to download the datasets, and the ability to filter those datasets on a map to prove workability. I assume there are a few more that I am missing, but I hope to clear those up with you and Diogo at our next meeting.

      <p> Generally progress has been ok but not perfect so far. I have been extremely behind on everything and a bit paranoid, due to early week slacking and the fact that any time I try to catch up anywhere both in this project and in other classes something goes wrong. This week, it has been my internet going everything I try to do work, pushing back the amount of work I can actually do.
	I generally appreciate the feedback you have given me about transitioning to google search over requests, however I do think I need to figure out how to better ask questions. It's something I'm noticing more and more in that I’m often a spectator when in the discussion and defer most of it to Diogo, and I should really be doing more. It's just that I don’t know what to say and I’m not quite confident in that setting, i plan on taking a more commanding role next meeting
	There have been a lot of adjustments. I have been thinking about my capstone to make minor adjustments. Due to issues on both sides, we are a bit behind on the timeline, but nothing we cannot catch up upon. However, many of the things we thought about adding if we had extra time, such as a complex analysis of the data, are likely shot due to this.
	For the implementations, due to the slowed progress I mainly got 2 things done since the demo: the changing of requests to google search which seems to be working well, and the connection of my code to diogo’s code. We finally got a barebones bot running and I hope this weekend is something we can actually find some data to get Mollie’s help
Sadly, due to the issues mentioned with the internet this week, I have not yet finished the revamp of chapter 1-3, besides the quick overhaul we did in class today. I plan on putting in significant work this weekend/next week, as my main goal is to make minor progress on capstone/ my other project class this weekend, while completing eliminating all work for the week as a whole, as such I can dedicate all of week 8 to catching up and advancing on my capstone project.

      <p> Generally, I feel a lot less nervous about last semesters work than I did at the start of the Semester. I came in feeling like I did essentialy nothing last semester, so I felt like I had a lot to prove, and my slow work on the first few weeks just added to it, including Molly’s harsh comments on our Paper. However, right now I feel quite confidence from where we are, and I do think I can make a great recovery on the work. Generally, I feel like we are going to have to crunch a bit more than I like, but otherwise I am fine.
For the First semester, we have made good progresson on the capstone. Genrally the capstone design for the demo is quite strong so far. There are 3 prongs we have to get done for the demo: Scraping google to find websites, Searching all links in thise websites to get a list of all things the websites link to, and downloading any files found upon those files. So far, 2 out of the 3 have been implimented, and finding all subdomains of a site is starting to be worked upon. So far we have none of the ideal conditions, including adding conditions for this searching, looking past the first page of google and a few more options, but those are for the beta next month.
Generally, a lot of the web scraping bot code has been easier than I expected. I assumed it was going to be a hastle, but its only been a few weeks to get it up and running really strong. I wish I put more time into doing it so we could be even further along. Generally, the main challenge I have come up with is doing some more research on the side, trying to reach out to other people while doing work. However, I still had have struggles on the coding end, mostly trying to figure out how to get past page 1 on google for web scraping.

      <p> Generally, my personal progress on the project has been a bit lacking in my mind, only softened by the fact that last semester we were not really doing the project in earnest. The final design document is in a strong place, with some minor revisions to parts already done, and work needing to be done on the newest sections. I took a large part of the design document with all of section 1, a bit over half of section 2, and a bit over half of section 3. For the project itself I have mostly been in research and data collection which has not been going well, as the data required is not the kind normally given out. However, I have gained a large variety of potential contacts, whether they be competitors or otherwise. Additionally, while it did not make results I made contact with numerous departments of agriculture and other parties that may hold information such as the NASS, UD department of agriculture, and some african agricultural companies, though none ever responded to me. 

For the winter break, I sadly did not get as much as I really should have gotten as it was a tough month for me. We had economic issues at the house so most of my time was spent helping my family with our business. However, I did get some things done.We never quite decided what our main package was going to be for web scraping, though we were learning towards beautiful soup. So I did some research into R-vest and decided that it would not be useful to our main objective, as while SQL would be nice Diogo has no knowledge of SQL, and thus we would be wasting precious time trying to learn it. Furthermore, scrapy was something that was a bit too command line focused for my tastes and could quite click with it, so that alternative was out. That left us with beautiful soup, which I did some personal research into and got a basic, but serviceable understanding coming into the semester. Additionally, I spent some free time looking for more websites, though that failed so the bot is probably the best.

For the next few weeks, my main goal is to go into overdrive, at least for me. I want the data bot running by the end of next week in some state, so we can find potential websites. I want the bot that takes those sites and actually scrapes the data working by the end of February. I’m hoping to get everything finalized by the end of March, with the design document being finalized by mid March. I’m essentially hoping we can leave the last few weeks of April for a nice relaxing fine tuning session.

      <h5>Problem and Purpose Statement, Oct 15, 2022</h5>
       <style>
         p{text-indent= 90px}

      <p> 
        Problem Statement :6Grain is an agricultural data company seeking to expand their gathering of boundary data, especially in Africa. However, they lack a way of finding data gathered on websites and other online entities, therefore they tasked us to seek out this data. 

As I was the one who mostly wrote the Purpose and Problem statements, I intend to give a lot more of the intent of why it was posted. For me, the main goal of the problem statement was to highlight 6 grains needed. While it feels a bit odd for a capstone, I am trying to get in the role of an outside consultant working for a client in this, and as such am trying to frame my ideas around that. So one of the main goals in writing this was to write it as I was such a consultant, making it clear it's what 6 Grain is looking for. 
For the actual statement itself, the thing I tried to emphasize was that actual data science is a more minimal role in the project, and is much more about data engineering. We are not going to use the data for anything for the most part,  with my assumption being most of the analysis will consist of basic models and checking to make sure that the data actually makes sense on maps.

Purpose Statement :Generally, we seek to provide web data in two ways. First off, we seek to find various holders of agricultural boundary data, and output them. The other end is finding data stored on the web and formatting it in a way harmonious with the 6 Grain workflow.
    
As I again mention, I was the one who wrote the problem and purpose statements, and the purpose statement in particular was a bit of a problem for me. Aside from the fact that I’m a bit unclear on the purpose statement, I have not crystalized in my mind exactly what the final solution is. As such, one of my goals was to make the purpose statement a bit more general and wide than normal at this stage, until I am clear upon what exactly we are working towards. Hence the focus on different ways of solving the problem, as it allows me to easily rewrite it when I get a better picture.
My main goal with making this purpose statement though was to show the breadth of options we intend to solve this problem with. Generally, this issue was more open ended than what I was originally expecting them to ask of us, with basically anything past the goal of finding web data being advice. As such, I wanted to display the options we at least for the moment, instead to pursue this goal around.

      <p> Currently my Capstone is going a bit behind, but I finally have all the tools to fix that. I could not make too much progress when I was unaware of what we 
       were supposed to do, but now that we have talked with 6Grain we can finally work on the important things.</p>
