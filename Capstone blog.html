        Problem Statement :6Grain is an agricultural data company seeking to expand their gathering of boundary data, especially in Africa. However, they lack a way of finding data gathered on websites and other online entities, therefore they tasked us to seek out this data. 

As I was the one who mostly wrote the Purpose and Problem statements, I intend to give a lot more of the intent of why it was posted. For me, the main goal of the problem statement was to highlight 6 grains needed. While it feels a bit odd for a capstone, I am trying to get in the role of an outside consultant working for a client in this, and as such am trying to frame my ideas around that. So one of the main goals in writing this was to write it as I was such a consultant, making it clear it's what 6 Grain is looking for. 
For the actual statement itself, the thing I tried to emphasize was that actual data science is a more minimal role in the project, and is much more about data engineering. We are not going to use the data for anything for the most part,  with my assumption being most of the analysis will consist of basic models and checking to make sure that the data actually makes sense on maps.

Purpose Statement :Generally, we seek to provide web data in two ways. First off, we seek to find various holders of agricultural boundary data, and output them. The other end is finding data stored on the web and formatting it in a way harmonious with the 6 Grain workflow.
    
As I again mention, I was the one who wrote the problem and purpose statements, and the purpose statement in particular was a bit of a problem for me. Aside from the fact that Iâ€™m a bit unclear on the purpose statement, I have not crystalized in my mind exactly what the final solution is. As such, one of my goals was to make the purpose statement a bit more general and wide than normal at this stage, until I am clear upon what exactly we are working towards. Hence the focus on different ways of solving the problem, as it allows me to easily rewrite it when I get a better picture.
My main goal with making this purpose statement though was to show the breadth of options we intend to solve this problem with. Generally, this issue was more open ended than what I was originally expecting them to ask of us, with basically anything past the goal of finding web data being advice. As such, I wanted to display the options we at least for the moment, instead to pursue this goal around.

      <p> Currently my Capstone is going a bit behind, but I finally have all the tools to fix that. I could not make too much progress when I was unaware of what we 
       were supposed to do, but now that we have talked with 6Grain we can finally work on the important things.</p>
